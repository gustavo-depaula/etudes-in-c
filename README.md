# études in C

Inspired by [pytudes](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes).

"An étude (a French word meaning study) is an instrumental musical composition, usually short, of considerable difficulty, and designed to provide practice material for perfecting a particular musical skill." — Wikipedia

For the past week (at the time of writing this), I have fallen in love with generic (void\*) pointers and function pointers. This has ignited a curiosity to explore these and other themes and their application.

Sadly (or gladly), my university course doesn't use "raw" C in any subjects (afaik). So these explorations have been for fun and knowledge only. The caveat is that some of the use cases I wrote are based on stolen assignments from friends' subjects in their universities.

Feel free to explore, review, use, and leave suggestions on any code in this repository!
